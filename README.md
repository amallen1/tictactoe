## Overview

### The challenge

A tic tac toe game where 2 players can go against each other and keep track of their wins, losses, and ties!

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that itâ€™s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so itâ€™s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use styled components a bit better because I was able to do things like dynamically rendering images based on props in order to display the X and O markers.

### Continued development

- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that itâ€™s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Implementing a player vs CPU mode. Also, instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so itâ€™s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win.
